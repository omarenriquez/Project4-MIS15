  "body": "### About The Project\r\nThis Project was for my MIS 15 class at Sac State. We had to build a multi form application that prompts the user to enter information about a product: Item Number, Price, Description, Manufacturer. The project prompted me to use all my knowledge about C#, including concepts such as data validation, encapsulation, classes, lists, methods, and exception handling.\r\n\r\n### How I Created The Project\r\nThe first step in creating the project was to obtain the prompt from the professor and establish the boundaries, guidelines, and steps that would allow me to complete the project\r\nThe next step was to create the Multi-form Windows Forms Application that would interact together, one form for the Item entry, a second form for the Item Maintenance.\r\n\r\n### What I Learned\r\nDuring this project I honed my previous skills learned at the beginning of the semester such as declaring variables and methods. The new things that I was able to learn in this project was creating a class such as the Data Validation Class that made it easier to validate data and also used for exception handling to catch user mistakes quickly and efficiently. I also learned how to handle data, such as saving information that the user entered and returning it back to the user when the reopen the application.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nAuthor: Omar Enriquez  \r\nDate Completed: December 6, 2016.  \r\nLanguage/Program Used: C# / Visual Studio 2012  \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n*Email: Omar Enriquez  \r\n*Phone: (949) 205-3984  \r\n*LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarenriquez>",
